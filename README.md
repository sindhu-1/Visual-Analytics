# Visual-Analytics
## A Shiny Web Application for the Geospatial Analysis of UK's Access to Health Assets and Hazards (AHAH).

This project aims to provide interactive and well-designed graphical presentations of the AHAH dataset to enhance usersâ€™ ability to calibrate robust geospatial models, using maps to visualize the outputs of the geospatial analysis.

Through this module I have learnt principles, techniques and best practices of data visualisation and various real-world applications of visual analytics.
